This is the DEVSIM distribution in a zip format.  Extract the files from
the archive into your preferred directory.  Product
documentation is available in the devsim/doc directory.

Mac OS X provides all of the necessary dependencies to run DEVSIM.

If you wish to use
Anaconda Python 2.7 from http://continuum.io/download

The following may be done to the binary file:
install_name_tool -change '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python' ~/anaconda/lib/libpython2.7.dylib devsim

These commands substitute the Intel MKL math libraries in place of the Mac OS X system versions. 
install_name_tool -change /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib ~/anaconda/lib/libmkl_rt.dylib devsim
install_name_tool -change /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libLAPACK.dylib ~/anaconda/lib/libmkl_rt.dylib devsim


Then set your environment variable using:
export PYTHONHOME=${HOME}/anaconda
